For this project, one of two final projects required to obtain my Data Science Professional Certification from Harvard EDX, I developed and evaluated stastical models for identifying "Moneyball" NBA players--profesisonal basketball players who based on their salary relative to their skills are undervalued. 

The final model made very good selections and output rankings for all players, including Moneyball players, that closely matched their rankings based on Player Efficiency Rating, a commonly used statistic to assess a player's overall skill and value.

Additionally, the model's weightings of different statistical categories had theoretical and practical implications for identifying what skills and talents, or combinations of such, are most related to success in the modern NBA.
