For this project, one of two final projects requited to obtain my Data Science Professional Certification from Harvard EDX, I developed a movie rating prediction system. The requirement to receive a top grade was an residual mean square error (RMSE) of .86490; my model achieved 0.85696. Most of the incremental improvement, above what any prediction model would get using the main effects of the movie title and the user supplying the rating, came from a thorough analysis of the user-genre effect, whereby individual users' preferences for specific types of movies was leveraged to improve the model's accuracy.
