For this project, one of two final projects required to obtain my Data Science Professional Certification from Harvard EDX, I developed a movie rating prediction system. 

The requirement to receive a top grade was a residual mean square error (RMSE) of .86490; my model achieved 0.85696. 

Most of the incremental improvement, above what any prediction model would get using the main effects of the move and the rater, came from a thorough analysis of the rater-genre effect, whereby individual users' preferences for specific types of movies was leveraged to improve the model's accuracy.
